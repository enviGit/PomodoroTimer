# PomodoroTimer

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into 25-minute intervals, separated by short breaks. The Pomodoro timer app is a desktop application that helps users apply the Pomodoro technique by providing a timer for the work and break sessions, as well as a list of completed sessions. Users can start, pause, or reset the timer, and view the remaining time for the current session. The app also includes a progress bar to show the overall progress of the current session. With this app, users can manage their time more efficiently and increase their productivity.
